#A simple tool to work with adyen skins


## How it works:

1. Fork the repo, run npm install
2. Copy your unzipped skin (generated in Adyen service admin panel) files into views/skin directory
3. run node app
4. You can now work on the skin elements.

Consult Adyen materials for some more info on skin structure.

##Notes:

+ At the moment, i am still not 100% sure about the markup Adyen generates - what I have here is scraped from some very old skins and other data I was able to find. I am going to test this more soon and update the container markup
+ Skin files are not part of this repo - remember to save them somewhere, or you might lose your work.
